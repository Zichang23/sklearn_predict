# Preditive Modeling for Crop Types

This project aims to leverage supervised machine learning techniques to assist farmers in selecting the most suitable crops for specific land areas based on soil characteristics. The dataset includes four predictors: soil metrics such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium levels, and pH. The target variable is the crop type, categorized as a multi-class classification problem.
